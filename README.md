# ml-reading-group
Using yeast DM fitness data to try out methods from ML reading group. 

## Using the repository:
1. Data is in the `data` folder 
2. When working on your computer, make sure all your documents are inside the folder with your name. 
3. By all working in separate folders, we should be able to avoid merge conflicts and all merges should be able to be fast-forwarded, but I would reccomend pulling before you start working, and push every time you stop working. If you get a request to explain why you're doing a merge (git on the command line will open the vim editor and ask you to type something), just type anything (press `i` to go into insert mode, then type) and close vim (`esc` and then `:wq`) and you'll be able to move on. 

Happy typing!
